1. Introduction In this project you will extend the Agents and Spaces assignment to include two new features: ‚Ä¢ Each space will have an image associated with it that will be shown when the agent moves into that space. ‚Ä¢ The information about spaces and portals will be stored in a conÔ¨Åguration Ô¨Åle that is external to the Java program itself. That means that it no longer requires Java programming skill to create a new set of spaces and portals.
Also, you will be given the opportunity to create some images of your own to use as visual representations of the spaces that you create.
Those of you familiar with games can think of the Java program as the game engine, and the conÔ¨Åguration Ô¨Åle as a single level. Right now only one conÔ¨Åguration Ô¨Åle is allowed.
2. Due Date This project is due by midnight at the end of the day on Sunday, March 29, 2015. A penalty of 20% per day will be deducted from your grade, starting at 12:00:01am. See this link for additional information.
3. Value This program is worth a maximum of 20 points. See the grading rubric at the end for a breakdown of the values of different parts of this project.
4. Objectives Here are some objectives of this assignment: ‚Ä¢ for loops ‚Ä¢ Data conversion from textual speciÔ¨Åcation into interconnected objects. ‚Ä¢ A bit of GUI programming. ‚Ä¢ Using some built-in classes, even if you don‚Äôt know how they work. Think about it: you can use anything as long as you know how the interface to that thing works. You don‚Äôt need to know how a car or a computer works in order to use it. The same is true for Java classes.
2
‚Ä¢ Using external jar Ô¨Åles in Eclipse.
5. Background This is a reasonable place to mention this: please place comment blocks in ALL your class Ô¨Åles, not just the Main class Ô¨Åle.
5.1. Private methods In this assignment I have you create several private methods. This is unusual, because usually methods are public. The reason I have you make the methods private is because they‚Äôre not needed outside the class in which they are created. If they can be made private, then they should be made private. Don‚Äôt expose internal features of a class unless you know that you should, meaning a variable or method should be private unless you know that it should be public.
5.2. INI Ô¨Åles I have written a Java library that you will use for this project (a library is a collection of classes that is not by itself a complete program). It allows your program to load conÔ¨Åguration data from an external Ô¨Åle. The the data in the Ô¨Åle follows the INI format that Microsoft Windows uses. You can read Wikipedia‚Äôs article about INI Ô¨Åles here.
The format of the data in the Ô¨Åle is simple. A Ô¨Åle has sections. Each section has a header in square brackets, and under each section there are properties (or key = value pairs), like this:
[section] key = value
The Ini class library loads an INI Ô¨Åle from disk and stores it in memory, and builds a logical structure from the sections in the Ô¨Åle. You can query the Ini structure for what the section names are, what properties are found in a speciÔ¨Åc section, what the value is for a given key in a given section. You can also add or change properties and have the new INI Ô¨Åle written back to disk.
The data stored in the INI Ô¨Åle is rudimentary, but it contains enough information to make your simulation conÔ¨Ågurable through this INI Ô¨Åle, which is separate from the program class Ô¨Åles. In this project you will write a ConÔ¨ÅgLoader class that will convert the INI Ô¨Åle into a collection of spaces and portals, just like what happens in your main method now.
You can even send your INI Ô¨Åle to a friend, and your friend can run your simulation without re-compiling the Java program.

This is what my main method used to look like:
Space classroom = new Space(); classroom.setName(‚Äúclassroom‚Äù); classroom.setDescription(‚Äúa large lecture hall‚Äù); Space sidewalk = new Space(); sidewalk.setName(‚Äúsidewalk‚Äù); sidewalk.setDescription(‚Äúa plain concrete sidewalk with weeds growing through the cracks‚Äù); Portal door = new Portal(); door.setName(‚Äúdoor‚Äù); door.setDirection(‚Äúoutside‚Äù); door.setDestination(sidewalk); classroom.setPortal(door); Agent student = new Agent(); student.setName(‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù); student.setLocation(classroom);
But now it looks like this:
File configFile = new File(‚Äúdata‚Äù, ‚Äúconfig.ini‚Äù); ConfigLoader cl = new ConfigLoader(configFile); Agent a = cl.load(); CommandInterpreter.run(a);
This is what my conÔ¨Åg.ini Ô¨Åle looks like:
[spaces] classroom = a large lecture hall sidewalk = a plain concrete sidewalk with weeds growing through the cracks [images] classroom = classroom.jpg sidewalk = sidewalk.jpg [portals] door = outside [exits] classroom = door [destinations] door = sidewalk [agents] Harry Potter = classroom
4
[start] agent = Harry Potter
This is the format of each section: ‚Ä¢ spaces: list each space in the form spaceName = spaceDescription ‚Ä¢ portals: list each portal in the form portalName = destinationDescription ‚Ä¢ exits: this connects spaces to their exit portals, the form is spaceName = portalName ‚Ä¢ destinations: this connects portals to their destinations, the form is portalName = destinationSpaceName ‚Ä¢ agents: list each agent in the form agentName = startSpaceName ‚Ä¢ start: list the starting agent in the form agent = startingAgentName
Note that for each exit in the exits section, the left hand side must refer to a space listed in the spaces section and the right hand side must be a portal listed in the portals section.
For each destination in the destinations section, the left hand side must be a portal in the portals section and the right hand side must be a space in the spaces section.
The start agent must be an agent listed in the agents section.
I know what you‚Äôre thinking, but right now the simulation does not handle more than one agent. üòâ
Getting values from the Ini instance If you call the get method on the Ini instance, it will return the value (right hand side) associated with a speciÔ¨Åc key (left hand side). For instance, have a look at the spaces section:
[spaces] classroom = a large lecture hall sidewalk = a plain concrete sidewalk with weeds growing through the cracks
Assume that you have the Ini instance stored in a variable called ini. The get method is used to retrieve the value associated with a key:
File iniFile = new File(‚Äúdata‚Äù, ‚Äúconfig.ini‚Äù); Ini ini = new Ini(iniFile); // loads the ini file
String section = ‚Äúspaces‚Äù; String key = ‚Äúclassroom‚Äù; String value = ini.get(section, key);
5
The value variable will then contain the string ‚Äúa large lecture hall‚Äù.
Note that the Ini instance stores only strings. In this assignment you will need to analyze the strings to build instances of Space, Portal, and Agent, and also connect them together.
6. Assignment Read through all of the subsections in this section before you start, to make sure you understand how you must proceed with the assignment.
6.1. Copy HW 3 Summary This project extends the previous assignment.
Do this Start Eclipse and make a copy of your HW 3 project. If your HW 3 project does not work, contact your TA to obtain a working copy of the project.
6.2. Modify Space class Summary It is not good programming to always rely on using a default constructor in a class, only to Ô¨Åll in the member variables later using setter methods. Instead, it is better to write a constructor that lets you supply more information when you create an instance.
Do this Add a private member variable to hold the name of the image that is to be associated with this space. The name of the image will be a String. Eclipse will complain that this member variable is not used. That‚Äôs Ô¨Åne for now. You will use it later.
Add a getter for this new member variable. Do not add a setter (once the Ô¨Åle name has been stored in the instance, we do not ever need to change it).
Add a constructor to this class that has one parameter for each member variable. Inside the constructor, store the arguments into the member variables. I will refer to this as a full, simple constructor. It is full in that it has one parameter for each member variable, and it is simple in that all it does is store the arguments into the member variables.
The order in which you place the parameters in the parameter list is irrelevant, as is the order of the member variables in the class.
6
Change the main method so that it uses this new constructor for the Space class. For instance, for one Space instance I have these three statements in my main method:
Space classroom = new Space(); classroom.setName(‚Äúclassroom‚Äù); classroom.setDescription(‚Äúa large lecture hall‚Äù);
These should be replaced with this one method:
Space classroom = new Space(‚Äúclassroom‚Äù, ‚Äúa large lecture hall‚Äù, null, null);
Be sure to remove the calls to the setter methods, as I have done. Do not actually delete the setter methods from the classes.
Notice that I don‚Äôt yet know what the portal and the image name are, so I use null in those positions in the argument list. Later you will write a class that will provide all four arguments when it creates a Space instance.
Testing After you change all the constructors, run the program again to be sure it works the same as it did before.
6.3. Modify Portal class Summary You will write a constructor for the Portal class as you did with the Space class.
Do this Write a full, simple constructor for the Portal class (it should have 3 parameters).
Change the main method so that this new constructor is used, and that there are no setters called on your Portal instances.
You will still need to call the setPortal method on your Space instances.
Testing Test your program again to be sure it still works the same way.
6.4. Modify Agent class Summary You will write a constructor for the Agent class as you did with the Space and Portal
7
classes.
Do this Write a full, simple constructor for the Agent class (it should have 2 parameters).
Change the main method so that this new constructor is used, and that there are no setters called on your Agent instance.
After making this modiÔ¨Åcation, the only setter methods called in the main method are the ones to set the portals of the spaces.
Testing Test your program again to be sure it still works the same way.
6.5. Create a data folder Summary This project will require the use of several data Ô¨Åles. These will be stored in a data folder in your project folder.
Do this Right click on the project in Eclipse and select New Folder. Make sure that the project is selected in the project list. Enter the folder name data. Click Finish.
Right click on the data folder and create a sub-folder named images.
Testing Just have a look to make sure that your folder arrangement is similar to mine:
6.6. Store some images in that folder Summary You will incorporate some images into your project. Later you will add some methods that display the image associated with whatever space the agent is in.
Do this
8
Download these two image Ô¨Åles and store them in the data/images folder in Eclipse. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2234170/courses/CSE1102/images/classroom.jpg https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2234170/courses/CSE1102/images/sidewalk.jpg
You can drag & drop the image Ô¨Åles right into Eclipse, then choose the option to copy the images.
Go back into the main method and add the image names to the Space constructors. Do not supply the full path, only the name of the image Ô¨Åle as it appears in the data/images folder. Here‚Äôs one of the Space constructors in my program:
Space classroom = new Space(‚Äúclassroom‚Äù, ‚Äúa large lecture hall‚Äù, ‚Äúclassroom.jpg‚Äù, null);
Testing Again, just verify that the Ô¨Åles are in the folder (yes, it was previously homework 4):
6.7. Use the imagewindow jar Ô¨Åle Summary I have written the classes that will do the work of displaying the images. All you need to do is install the jar Ô¨Åle and then call the right methods at the right time.
Do this Download this Ô¨Åle and place it in your ExternalLibs folder in Eclipse. https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2234170/courses/CSE1102/jars/imagewindow-1.0.jar See section 5.3 in project 2 (Robot Grid) if you need instructions on how to do this.
PLEASE NOTE: Don‚Äôt just include the jar Ô¨Åle in the build path. Instead, you should set up a path variable for this called IMAGEWINDOW. That way when your TA loads your project into Eclipse, your project will refer to the variable, which will point to where the jar Ô¨Åle is on his computer instead of where it is on your computer, which is undoubtedly in a different place. View this video to learn how to set up a variable for the imagewindow jar Ô¨Åle. https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2234170/courses/CSE1102/videos/EclipseVar.mov
9
After you set up the jar Ô¨Åle, create an ImageWindow instance in the main method and store it in a variable (the class is in jeff.imagewindow). It should be very easy. There is only a default constructor for this class. Supply this variable as an argument to the CommandInterpreter.run method. This means that you must also add it as a parameter in the CommandInterpreter.run method. Do that now.
Write a private static void method in the CommandInterpreter class called _showImage (I like to use underscores with private methods, too). This method should have two parameters: an ImageWindow and an Agent. Get the name of the image associated with the agent‚Äôs space, then display the image by using these three statements:
File imageDir = new File(‚Äúdata‚Äù, ‚Äúimages‚Äù); File imageFile = new File(imageDir, imageName); imageWindow.loadImage(imageFile);
Where imageName is deÔ¨Åned by you in this method, and imageWindow is the parameter.
Back in the run method, call the _showImage method just before the do loop starts.
In the part of the if/else ladder where you handle the ‚Äúgo‚Äù command, after you call the usePortal method, call the _showImage method the same way you did before the do loop. This will cause the image to change each time the agent moves.
Testing Run the program. You should see your program running in the console, but an additional window should appear showing the image for the current space. This is what mine looks like:
10
Hmm, this is terribly inconvenient. Eclipse covers the image window each time you need to type in the console. We‚Äôll Ô¨Åx that next.
6.8. Use the textconsole jar Ô¨Åle Summary I have written another jar Ô¨Åle for you to use. This one places the console in a window that is separate from Eclipse. This way you can have the image window and the console window both on top of Eclipse at the same time.
The console that I have created provides these methods that you will can use: ‚Ä¢ void print(String) ‚Ä¢ void println(String) ‚Ä¢ String readLine()
Do this Download and install the textconsole jar Ô¨Åle from this link: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2234170/courses/CSE1102/jars/textconsole-1.0.jar Add a new variable in the build path for this jar Ô¨Åle. Call it TEXTCONSOLE.
In the main method create an instance of TextConsole and store it in a variable (the class is in jeff.textconsole), but in order to do this you will need to call the static method TextConsole.create() instead of calling new TextConsole(). [Nerd stuff, not on the exam: The TextConsole instance must be created inside a concurrent thread, so the TextConsole.create method spawns a new thread, creates a new instance, and then returns the instance. You can look at the Java source code in the jar Ô¨Åle if you like.]
11
Pass the text console instance as an argument to the run method. This means you must add yet another parameter to the CommandInterpreter.run method.
Inside the run method, replace every System.out with the name of the text console variable. For example, in my run method, the text console parameter variable is called textConsole, so I will change this statement:
System.out.println(agent.getName() + ‚Äù is in ‚Äù + agent.getLocation().toString());
to this:
textConsole.println(agent.getName() + ‚Äù is in ‚Äù + agent.getLocation().toString());
Also add a TextConsole parameter to the Agent.usePortal method, and change the System.out there also. Eclipse indicates that there is now an error in the CommandInterpreter.run method, but its suggestion how to correct the error should be the right one (a TextConsole instance must be supplied as an argument to the usePortal method).
Now with the text console you no longer need to use the Scanner. Get rid of the Scanner and change the call to kbd.next() (or however you called the next method) to be textConsole.readLine().
Finally, in the run method but below the end of the loop, add this statement:
System.exit(0);
Just by typing the quit command the run method‚Äôs loop ends, but the text console does not end because it runs in a concurrent thread [beyond scope of this course]. The call to System.exit(0) ensures that the thread is terminated.
Testing Test it. It should work.
12
6.9. Use the ini jar Ô¨Åle Summary The ini jar Ô¨Åle contains an Ini class that I have written for you that will load conÔ¨Åguration data from a Ô¨Åle and store it in memory. All the data is stored as strings. It is your responsibility to convert the conÔ¨Åguration data into actual Spaces, Portals, and an Agent.
Do this Yep, another jar Ô¨Åle. This is the one I discussed in the background section of this document. https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2234170/courses/CSE1102/jars/ini-1.0.jar Add a new variable in the build path for this jar Ô¨Åle. Call it INIFILE.
Create a class called ConÔ¨ÅgLoader. Start with this deÔ¨Ånition:
public class ConfigLoader { private Ini _ini; private HashMap<String, Space _spaces = new HashMap<String, Space(); private HashMap<String, Portal _portals = new HashMap<String, Portal(); private HashMap<String, Agent _agents = new HashMap<String, Agent();
public ConfigLoader(File iniFile) { _ini = new Ini(iniFile); }
13
public Agent buildAll() { //_buildSpaces(); //_buildPortals(); //_buildExits(); //_buildDestinations(); //_buildAgents(); //return _selectStartAgent(); return null; } }
The Ini class is in jeff.ini. The HashMap class is in java.util. The File class is in java.io.
When a new Ini instance is created, it automatically loads the data from the disk Ô¨Åle. Now all that is left is to read the data from the tables inside the Ini instance in the _ini variable, and create instances of things from them.
The load method refers to 6 undeÔ¨Åned private methods. You will deÔ¨Åne these methods.
Testing Make sure everything still works as before.
6.10. Create conÔ¨Åg.ini Ô¨Åle in data folder Summary Before the Ini class can do its thing, there needs to be an ini Ô¨Åle for it to read.
Do this Create a new text Ô¨Åle in Eclipse called conÔ¨Åg.ini and save it in the data folder in this project. This Ô¨Åle must contain valid conÔ¨Åguration data in the INI format. It‚Äôs probably best to start with the example I gave in the background section (just copy & paste). After you get your program working, then you can change the ini Ô¨Åle to represent your own set of spaces and portals.
Testing Make sure that the conÔ¨Åg.ini Ô¨Åle appears in the data folder:
14
6.10. Add _buildSpaces method Summary This method will create a number of Space instances based on the information that was loaded from the conÔ¨Åg.ini Ô¨Åle. The HashMaps in the ConÔ¨ÅgLoader instance are used to store Space, Portal, and Agent instances until the entire connected space can be built. A HashMap is like a dictionary: you give it a word, and it tells you the deÔ¨Ånition. Only here the word is the name of the instance (like ‚Äúclassroom‚Äù), so the get method called on the HashMap instance returns the Space instance that has that name.
Do this This method is private, returns nothing, and has no parameters. All the information it needs is in the Ini instance, and it stores the Spaces it creates in the HashMap.
The keys method called on a HashMap will give you a collection of keys in a speciÔ¨Åc section. For example, in my conÔ¨Åg.ini Ô¨Åle I have this spaces section:
[spaces] classroom = a large lecture hall sidewalk = a plain concrete sidewalk with weeds growing through the cracks
So this method call _ini.keys(‚Äúspaces‚Äù) will return the strings ‚Äúclassroom‚Äù and ‚Äúsidewalk‚Äù. Fortunately you don‚Äôt have to worry about what form that collection is in (it‚Äôs a Set for(String spaceName : _ini.keys(‚Äúspaces‚Äù)) { }
Whatever the keys (space names) are in the spaces section, this for loop will place one at a time in the spaceName variable and run the body of the loop.
In the body of the loop do this: 1. Get the description of the space: The descriptions are stored in the spaces section of
15
the INI Ô¨Åle. Since the name of the space is already in the spaceName variable, the description is the value returned by _ini.get(‚Äúspaces‚Äù, spaceName). 2. Get the image name of the space. That information is in the images section of the INI Ô¨Åle. 3. Create a new Space instance using all the information you know: name, description, image Ô¨Åle name. Use the value null as the space‚Äôs portal. You don‚Äôt have that information yet. 4. Place the space instance in the _spaces table for temporary safe keeping (by table I mean HashMap instance). Use this statement: _spaces.put(spaceName, spaceInstance); Remember: the Ini instance stores only strings. The HashMaps store instances of other classes.
Un-comment the call to _buildSpaces() in the buildAll method and place this statement below it:
System.out.println(_spaces);
Modify the main method Delete all the statements that create new instances of Space, Portal, and Agent. Actually, here‚Äôs what your main method should look like:
TextConsole console = TextConsole.create(); ImageWindow imageWindow = new ImageWindow(); File configFile = new File(‚Äúdata‚Äù, ‚Äúconfig.ini‚Äù); ConfigLoader cl = new ConfigLoader(configFile); Agent a = cl.buildAll(); CommandInterpreter.run(console, imageWindow, a);
If you copy & paste that, be sure to put a comment there that says ‚Äúgiven to us by Jeff‚Äù so that your TA understands that you‚Äôre not trying to pass it off as your own work.
Testing Run it. Here‚Äôs the output in the Eclipse console window.
{classroom=classroom, sidewalk=sidewalk} Exception in thread ‚Äúmain‚Äù java.lang.NullPointerException at CommandInterpreter.run(CommandInterpreter.java:13) at Main.main(Main.java:18)
The error is because we didn‚Äôt build the Agent yet (and your line numbers will probably be
16
different), but the part before that is the contents of the HashMap. The keys are classroom and sidewalk, and the values are‚Ä¶ also classroom and sidewalk?
Actually this is correct. The values are instances of Space, and when the HashMap displays the values it calls the toString method on the instance. The toString method in the Space class just displays the name of the space. It‚Äôs sort of like this:
{classroom=classroomSpace.toString(), sidewalk=sidewalkSpace.toString()}
Delete the println statement after you verify that the method works.
6.11. Add _buildPortals method Summary This method will build Portal instances from the data in the Ini instance.
[portals] door = outside
Do this Similar to the _buildSpaces method: For each portal name in the portals section: 1. Get the portal‚Äôs description 2. Create a new Portal instance using the name and description. Use null for the portal‚Äôs destination. 3. Store the instance in the _portals table using the portals name as the key.
Un-comment the call to _buildPortals in the buildAll method, and below that display the _portals table just for testing.
Testing Here‚Äôs mine. There‚Äôs only one portal deÔ¨Åned in my conÔ¨Åg.ini Ô¨Åle:
{door=door that goes outside} Exception in thread ‚Äúmain‚Äù java.lang.NullPointerException at CommandInterpreter.run(CommandInterpreter.java:13) at Main.main(Main.java:18)
6.12. Add _buildExits method Summary
17
This method does not create any new instances. The Spaces and Portals are all stored in the tables. Recall how the exits are speciÔ¨Åed in the INI Ô¨Åle:
[exits] classroom = door
The key is the name of the space and the value is the name of the portal. All that needs to be done is to fetch both from the tables and assign the portal as the space‚Äôs exit portal.
Do this For each space name in the exits section: 1. Get the name of that space‚Äôs exit portal from the _ini instance. 2. Get the actual Space instance from the table: _spaces.get(spaceName) 3. Get the Portal instance from the _portals table. Use the portal name, not the space name. 4. Set the space‚Äôs portal to that portal instance.
Un-comment the call to _buildExits in the buildAll method.
Testing This can‚Äôt easily be tested. The portal‚Äôs destination space is still null, and it causes the program to crash if you try to display it. Just proceed to the next step.
6.13. Add _buildDestinations method Summary This method works almost the same as the _buildExits method. It does not create any new instances. Recall how the destinations are speciÔ¨Åed in the INI Ô¨Åle:
[destinations] door = sidewalk
The key is the name of the portal and the value is the name of the space. All that needs to be done is to fetch both from the tables and assign the space as the portal‚Äôs destination.
Do this For each portal name in the destinations section: get the Portal instance that has the speciÔ¨Åed name, then get the Space instance that has the name of that portal‚Äôs destination (hint: the portal‚Äôs destination is currently null: where do you Ô¨Ånd that information?), then set that portal‚Äôs destination to be that space.
18
If the space that get from the portal is equal to null, then display some kind of error message and then call System.exit(1). This will terminate the program, because it can‚Äôt proceed if it determines that the space is null.
Un-comment the call to _buildDestinations in the buildAll method.
Testing Now that all spaces and portals are connected to each other you can check to see if the classroom space has been set up correctly. Add this statement below the _buildDestinations() method call:
System.out.println(_spaces.get(‚Äúclassroom‚Äù).toStringLong());
Here‚Äôs what mine shows:
classroom: a large lecture hall with a door that goes outside to sidewalk Exception in thread ‚Äúmain‚Äù java.lang.NullPointerException at CommandInterpreter.run(CommandInterpreter.java:13) at Main.main(Main.java:18)
6.14. Add _buildAgents method Summary This shows that there is one agent named Harry Potter and the name of the start location for that agent is classroom:
[agents] Harry Potter = classroom
Do this For each agent in the agents section: get the agent‚Äôs starting location name, get the Space instance that has that name. If the space is null, show an error message and exit. Otherwise create a new Agent instance having that name and that start location. Store the agent in the _agents table. Use the agent‚Äôs name as the key.
Testing You can use System.out.println(_agents) in the buildAll method to see the contents of the table:
{Harry Potter=Harry Potter} Exception in thread ‚Äúmain‚Äù java.lang.NullPointerException at CommandInterpreter.run(CommandInterpreter.java:13) at Main.main(Main.java:18)
19
Same as before: the Agent.toString method shows only the Agent instance‚Äôs name, so that‚Äôs what you see on the right side of the equal sign.
6.15. Add _selectStartAgent method Summary The conÔ¨Åg.ini Ô¨Åle has one more section. It speciÔ¨Åes what agent will be considered the central agent of the simulation.
[start] agent = Harry Potter
Do this Fetch the name of the start agent from the _ini instance. Locate the agent having that name name. If the agent instance is null, display an error message and exit the program. Otherwise, return that agent from this method.
Un-comment the return _selectStartAgent() method call and delete the return null statement.
Testing If this works, then your program will start working immediately.
Make sure you delete all the System.out.println methods in the buildAll method.
20
6.16. Create your own conÔ¨Åg.ini Ô¨Åle Summary Now is your opportunity to get creative. You will change the conÔ¨Åg.ini Ô¨Åle to be something of your own design, and you will also supply some images that go along with the spaces you create.
Either use the spaces and portals like you had in the last project, or create something new.
Do this Use the interwebs to locate some images that are representative of the spaces in your project (only the spaces, not the portals or the agent). Please do your best to ensure that the images are not illegal to use (which is unfortunately, like, most images online).
An ideal alternative is to show off your mad MS Paint skillz. That means draw your own images. Actually I don‚Äôt recommend MS Paint. Download GIMP or Inkscape some other drawing program. If you choose to draw your own images, they don‚Äôt have to be wondrous works of art, but do put more than a few minutes into it. Creativity is more important than skill.
You could also draw some images on paper and then take pictures of the drawings. I believe you can buy crayons at the Co-op. Seriously, crayon drawings would be awesome.
For example, some of the images shown here are quite compelling, and probably didn‚Äôt take too long to make.
Save the images as PNG or JPG Ô¨Åles in the data/images folder. You can drag & drop the image Ô¨Åles right into Eclipse, then choose the option to copy the images.
Testing Make sure it all works.
7. Report Create a Microsoft Word or OpenOfÔ¨Åce Word Ô¨Åle (or some other format that your TA agrees on ‚Äî ask him or her if you are not sure). Save the Ô¨Åle with a .doc or .docx format.
At the beginning of the document include this information:
Project title goes here CSE1102 Project project-number, semester Your name goes here
21
The current date goes here TA: Your TA‚Äôs name goes here Section: Your section number goes here Instructor: Jeffrey A. Meunier
Be sure to replace the parts that are underlined above.
Now create the following three sections in your document. 1. Introduction In this section copy & paste the text from the introduction section of this assignment. (It‚Äôs not plagiarism if you have permission to copy something. I give you permission.) 2.

9. Notes Here are some notes about this project: ‚Ä¢ The Build path variables in Eclipse must be named exactly as I specify, otherwise the program will not run after your TA imports your project. You do not want to make extra work for your TA.

Your TA will grade your assignment based on these criteria: ‚Ä¢ (2 points) The comment blocks at the beginning of the class Ô¨Åles are correct. ‚Ä¢ (11 points) The program is written correctly and works correctly (i.e., it doesn‚Äôt work correctly by accident). ‚Ä¢ (4 points) The program is formatted neatly. ‚Ä¢ (3 points) The document contains all the correct information and is formatted neatly.
11. Getting help Start your project early, because you will probably not be able to get help in the last few hours before the project is due. ‚Ä¢ If you need help, send e-mail to your TA immediately. ‚Ä¢ Go to the ofÔ¨Åce hours for (preferably) your TA or any other TA. I suggest you seeing your own TA Ô¨Årst because your TA will know you better. However, don‚Äôt let that stop you from seeing any TA for help. ‚Ä¢ Send e-mail to Jeff. ‚Ä¢ Go to Jeff‚Äôs ofÔ¨Åce hours.
